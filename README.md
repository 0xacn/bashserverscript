# bashserverscript
This is a bash script that pulls a github repo and cd's into the directory builds a docker image from it then creates a container out of it by running the image made for these scripts 
this only builds the bots image which isnt a multi-container application so there is no docker-compose..

### I use this for easily pulling my github repositorys and then building an image from a dockerfile.. it make it alot easier to create images and pull new changes and tag my new images rather than doing it manually
