# bashserverscript
This is a bash script i made so it automates the process of pulling new changes from github then building an image from the docker file.


### How to run it:

### Step 1 Pull the specificed github repo 
To do this include the github repos url eg: https://github.com/FFlop/arduinolcd

### Step 2 

In the bash scripted for the docker build command specify the name of the image so when it gets built it gets tagged as that image.

### Step 3
