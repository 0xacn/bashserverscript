# bashserverscript
This is a bash script that pulls a github repo and cd's into the directory builds a docker image from it then creates a container out of it by running the image made for these scripts 
this only builds the bots image which isnt a multi-container application so there is no docker-compose..

### I use this mostly for my repo for @discordutilitybot for its server and building new images
